Save a comprehensive end-of-session summary. Call this when a session is ending or when significant work is complete. This creates a structured summary that future sessions will use to understand what happened.

FORMAT — use this exact structure in the content field:

## Goal
[One sentence: what were we building/working on in this session]

## Instructions
[User preferences, constraints, or context discovered during this session. Things a future agent needs to know about HOW the user wants things done. Skip if nothing notable.]

## Discoveries
- [Technical finding, gotcha, or learning 1]
- [Technical finding 2]
- [Important API behavior, config quirk, etc.]

## Accomplished
- ✅ [Completed task 1 — with key implementation details]
- ✅ [Completed task 2 — mention files changed]
- 🔲 [Identified but not yet done — for next session]

## Relevant Files
- path/to/file.ts — [what it does or what changed]
- path/to/other.go — [role in the architecture]

GUIDELINES:
- Be CONCISE but don't lose important details (file paths, error messages, decisions)
- Focus on WHAT and WHY, not HOW (the code itself is in the repo)
- Include things that would save a future agent time
- The Discoveries section is the most valuable — capture gotchas and non-obvious learnings
- Relevant Files should only include files that were significantly changed or are important for context
