Save an important observation to persistent memory. Call this PROACTIVELY after completing significant work — don't wait to be asked.

WHEN to save (call this after each of these):
- Architectural decisions or tradeoffs
- Bug fixes (what was wrong, why, how you fixed it)
- New patterns or conventions established
- Configuration changes or environment setup
- Important discoveries or gotchas
- File structure changes

FORMAT for content — use this structured format:
  **What**: [concise description of what was done]
  **Why**: [the reasoning, user request, or problem that drove it]
  **Where**: [files/paths affected, e.g. src/auth/middleware.ts, internal/store/store.go]
  **Learned**: [any gotchas, edge cases, or decisions made — omit if none]

TITLE should be short and searchable, like: "JWT auth middleware", "FTS5 query sanitization", "Fixed N+1 in user list"

Examples:
  title: "Switched from sessions to JWT"
  type: "decision"
  content: "**What**: Replaced express-session with jsonwebtoken for auth\n**Why**: Session storage doesn't scale across multiple instances\n**Where**: src/middleware/auth.ts, src/routes/login.ts\n**Learned**: Must set httpOnly and secure flags on the cookie, refresh tokens need separate rotation logic"

  title: "Fixed FTS5 syntax error on special chars"
  type: "bugfix"
  content: "**What**: Wrapped each search term in quotes before passing to FTS5 MATCH\n**Why**: Users typing queries like 'fix auth bug' would crash because FTS5 interprets special chars as operators\n**Where**: internal/store/store.go — sanitizeFTS() function\n**Learned**: FTS5 MATCH syntax is NOT the same as LIKE — always sanitize user input"
